    "I’m a third-year Electrical Engineering student at Ariel University, specializing in signal processing, communications, and embedded systems. I focus on transforming theoretical concepts into practical tools — from audio analyzers and DSP visualizations to custom hardware and embedded solutions.",
    "This site documents my engineering journey: projects, experiments, and ongoing work that reflect how I learn, build, and iterate. Some projects are polished, others are exploratory, but all are driven by curiosity, hands-on problem solving, and a desire to understand systems deeply."
