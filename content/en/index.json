    "I’m a third-year Electrical Engineering student at Ariel University, where I spend most of my time exploring signal processing, communications, and embedded systems. I enjoy turning concepts into working tools — whether it’s an audio analyzer, a medical-signal device, or a custom circuit that solves a real problem.",
    "This site is a place where I share what I’m learning and building. You’ll find a mix of research, experiments, and side projects — some successful, some still in progress — all driven by curiosity and a love for engineering."
